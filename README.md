# Quasar Classification with Machine Learning an Artificial Intelligence methods on JPAS Data

This project focuses on classifying quasars by applying machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques—such as decision trees, random forests, and simple neural networks—using photometric data from the JPAS survey. The goal is to accurately distinguish quasars from other astronomical objects, contributing to astrophysical research and data analysis methods.

## About Me

I am passionate about applying physics and engineering principles to solve complex problems, especially in astrophysics, space technology, finance and data science. With a background in Engineering Physics, I have strong skills in mathematics, programming (Matlab and Python), and machine learning.

My interests include the intersection of artificial intelligence and finance, focusing on portfolio optimization using reinforcement learning and neural networks. I also enjoy learning new languages and exploring how technology can improve decision-making across domains.

I aim to work on practical projects that bridge theory and real-world applications, particularly in space systems, machine learning, and financial analysis.

## Project Structure

- `data/` - Contains the JPAS photometric dataset (NOT AVAILABLE)
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks with data exploration and model training

### Data Availability

The dataset used in this project (JPAS photometric data) is **not included** in this repository due to data access restrictions and is not publicly available. To work with the data, you need to request access from the JPAS collaboration or use your own authorized dataset.


## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib


## Usage

1. Prepare the JPAS dataset in the `data/` folder (ONLY IF YOU ALREADY HAVE IT)
2. Run the preprocessing scripts in `scripts/`.
3. Train models using the notebooks or scripts.
4. Evaluate and visualize results.
