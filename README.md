# Quasar-Classification-with-Machine-Learning-and-Artificial-Intelligence-Methods-on-JPAS-Data
Project focused on classifying quasars by applying machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques (such as decision trees, random forests, and simple neural networks) using photometric data from the JPAS survey. The goal is to accurately distinguish quasars from other astronomical objects.
